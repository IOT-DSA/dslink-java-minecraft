# Minecraft DSLink

The Minecraft DSLink uses MinecraftForge to provide information about the server.

## Building

***For all platforms, you'll need to copy dslink.json to the run-directory, which
should be a directory that contains other directories necessary to Forge, such as
config, world, etc.***

### Windows

```gradlew.bat jar```

### Linux/OS X

```./gradlew jar```
